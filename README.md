s
## AdapterAssetsManager is [Ownable](#ownable)

Base contract for `AdapterRegistry` contract.
Implements logic connected with `Adapter`s and their `assets` management.

### State variables

```
mapping(address => address) internal adapters;
mapping(address => address[]) internal assets;
```

### `onlyOwner` functions

#### `function addAdapter(address adapter, address[] calldata _assets)`

New adapter is added before the first existing adapter.

#### `function removeAdapter(address adapter)`

#### `function addAdapterAsset(address adapter, address asset)`

New asset is added after the last adapter's asset.

#### `function removeAdapterAsset(address adapter, uint256 assetIndex)`

### `view` functions

#### `function getAdapterAssets(address adapter) returns (address[] memory)`

#### `function getAdapters() returns (address[] memory)`

## Ownable 

Base contract for `AdapterAssetsManager` and `Logic` contracts.
Implements `Ownable` logic.
Includes `onlyOwner` modifier, `transferOwnership()` function, and public state variable `owner`. 

## AaveAdapter is [Adapter](#Adapter-abstract-contract)

Adapter for Aave protocol.

## CompoundAdapter is [Adapter](#Adapter-abstract-contract)

Adapter for Compound protocol.

## CurveAdapter is [Adapter](#Adapter-abstract-contract)

Adapter for [curve.fi](https://compound.curve.fi/) protocol.
Currently, there is the only pool with cDAI/cUSDC locked on it.

## DSRAdapter is [Adapter](#Adapter-abstract-contract)

Adapter for DSR protocol.

## MCDAdapter is [Adapter](#Adapter-abstract-contract)

Adapter for MCD vaults.

## MKRAdapter (abstract contract)

Base contract for Maker adapters.
It includes all the required constants and `pure` functions with calculations.

## PoolTogetherAdapter is [Adapter](#Adapter-abstract-contract)

Adapter for PoolTogether protocol.

## SynthetixAdapter is [Adapter](#Adapter-abstract-contract)

Adapter for Synthetix protocol.

`getAssetAmount()` function returns the following amounts:
- amount of SNX tokens locked by minting sUSD tokens (positive);
- amount of sUSD that should be burned to unlock SNX tokens (negative).

## ZrxAdapter is [Adapter](#Adapter-abstract-contract)

Adapter for Zrx protocol.

## Adapter (abstract contract)

Base contract for protocol adapters.
Includes all the functions required to be implemented.
Should be stateless.
Only `internal constant` state variables may be used.

### Functions

#### `function getProtocolName() external pure virtual returns (string memory)`

MUST return name of the protocol.

#### `getAssetAmount(address, address) external view virtual returns (uint256)`

MUST return amount of the given asset locked on the protocol by the given user.

#### `function getUnderlyingRates(address asset) external view virtual returns (Component[] memory)`

MUST return struct with underlying assets exchange rates for the given asset.

Exchange rate is a number, such that 

```
underlying asset amount = asset amount * exchange rate / 1e18
``` 

Note: rates are scaled by `1e18` due to rounding issues.

## Logic

0. (optional) Verifies the supplied signature and extracts the address of spender from it. 
1. Iterates over array of actions, checks adapter in `AdapterRegistry`, and `delegatecall`s corresponding `InteractiveAdapter` with assets, amounts, and additional data as arguments (deposit, or withdraw).
2. Returns all the resulting tokens back to the user.

```
function executeActions(Action[] actions) external payable
function executeActions(Action[] actions, Approval[] approvals, bytes signature) external payable
```

## TokenSpender

Sends all the assets under the request of Logic contract. Adds all the transferred assets to the list of withdrawable/toBeWithdrawn/resulting tokens.

```
function transferApprovedAssets(Approval[] approvals) external returns (address[])
```

## InteractiveAdapter is [Adapter](#Adapter-abstract-contract) (abstract contract)

Base contract for protocol wrappers.
Includes all the functions required to be implemented.
Should be stateless.
Only `internal constant` state variables may be used.

### Functions

#### `deposit(address, uint256, bytes memory) external payable virtual returns (address[] memory)`

Deposits assets to the lending/borrow/swap/liquidity.
MUST return addresses of the assets sent back to the `msg.sender`.

#### `withdraw(address, uint256, bytes memory) external payable virtual returns (address[] memory)`

Withdraws assets from the lending/borrow/swap/liquidity.
MUST return addresses of the assets sent back to the `msg.sender`.

## Use-cases for Logic contract

### Swap cDAI to DSR (Chai)

The following actions array will be sent to `Logic` contract:

```
[
    {
        actionType: ActionType.Withdraw,
        InteractiveAdapter: <address of cDAI wrapper>,
        asset: 0x5d3a536e4d6dbd6114cc1ead35777bab948e3643,
        amount: Amount({
            amountType: AmountType.Relative,
            value: RELATIVE_AMOUNT_BASE
        }),
        data: ""
    },
    {
        actionType: ActionType.Deposit,
        InteractiveAdapter: <address of chai wrapper>,
        asset: 0x5d3a536e4d6dbd6114cc1ead35777bab948e3643,
        amount: Amount({
            amountType: AmountType.Relative,
            value: RELATIVE_AMOUNT_BASE
        }),
        data: ""
    }
]
```

Logic layer should do the following:

1. Call `redeem()` function with `getAssetAmount(address(this))` argument.
2. Approve DAI to `Chai` contract.
3. Call `join()` function with `address(this)` and `getAssetAmount(address(this))` arguments.
4. Add Chai token to the list of withdrawable/toBeWithdrawn/resulting tokens.

## Dev notes

This project uses Truffle and web3js for all Ethereum interactions and testing.

### Adding new adapter

To add new adapter with read-only functionality, one have to inherit from `Adapter` contract.
`getProtocolName()`, `getAssetAmount()`, and `getUnderlyingRates()` functions MUST be implemented.

Note: only `internal constant` state variables and `internal` functions MUST be used.

`getProtocolName()` function has no arguments and MUST return the name of protocol.

`getAssetAmount(address,address)` function has two arguments of `address` type: the first one is asset address and the second one is user address.
The function MUST return amount of given asset held on the protocol for given user.

`getUnderlyingRates(address)` function has only one argument â€“ asset address.
The function MUST return all the underlying assets and their exchange rates scaled by `1e18`.

To add new adapter with deposit/withdraw functionality, one have to inherit from
 `InteractiveAdapter` contract.
Then, implement `deposit()` and `withdraw()` functions.
Both functions MUST return addresses of the assets sent back to the `msg.sender`, except for ETH.
Functions from `Adapter` contract MUST be implemented as well.

### Available Functionality

#### Compile contracts

`npm run compile`

#### Run tests

`npm run test`

#### Run Solidity code coverage

`npm run coverage`

#### Run Solidity and JS linters
